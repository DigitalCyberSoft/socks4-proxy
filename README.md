# socks4-proxy

This project was created many years ago to demonstrate a very simple and small Socks4 Proxy written in Delphi.

The project has been hosted since 2005 at http://www.digitalcybersoft.com/BPS/ however due to poor management of virus defintition companies, every few years the project gets marked as a virus or malware, or some other false positive.

Because of this we've decided to make the project open source. To compile the project you need Delphi, and to get it to 11KB you need UPX https://upx.github.io/
